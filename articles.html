  <h2>GWI's Connecting the Dots 2025 Report: 8 Key Consumer Trends</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
  <img src="images/trends_20.png" alt="Trends 2025 Graphic" style="width: 80%; max-width: 800px; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>
  <p>The latest report from GWI highlights 8 major shifts in consumer behavior that will shape the market in 2025:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Podcasts are reshaping the ad game:</strong><br>
      Podcasts have overtaken radio as the preferred audio format. Ads in podcasts are becoming more powerful thanks to high listener trust and deeper engagement with hosts.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Side hustles are the new normal:</strong><br>
      More people — not just Gen Z — are taking on side jobs or passion projects. It reflects a shift in how careers are viewed, with greater focus on freedom, flexibility, and financial independence.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The women’s sports boom:</strong><br>
      There’s a growing global interest in women’s sports, creating new opportunities for brands and sponsors. The rise of leagues like the WNBA and women’s football shows this isn’t just a moment — it’s a movement.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Energy drinks go mainstream:</strong><br>
      Nearly half of all consumers now drink energy drinks regularly. The audience is becoming more diverse, expanding beyond the typical young male demographic.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Teens are rethinking college:</strong><br>
      Young people, especially in the U.S. and UK, are starting to question the value of traditional university degrees. Many are choosing online learning, apprenticeships, or direct routes into tech and creative careers.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Smart home security tech quietly rises:</strong><br>
      Interest in smart home security systems is steadily increasing. Consumers value connected, tech-based solutions that offer both safety and convenience — a quiet but impactful trend.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Video podcast ads are on the rise:</strong><br>
      Video podcasts, especially on YouTube, are gaining popularity. Brands are taking advantage by placing visual ads, product placements, and logos within recorded shows and livestreams.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>TikTok Shop drives social commerce:</strong><br>
      TikTok Shop is transforming online shopping. Half of U.S. users have made a purchase through the platform, and 90% say they’d do it again. Fashion, beauty, and lifestyle lead the way, but quality and trust are growing concerns.
